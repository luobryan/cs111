Description of Files:
README is this file

Makefile is used to make the file. The 'default' target builds both versions
of the program (lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls). The 'clean' target removes all
programs and output created by the Makefile, restoring the 
directory to its freshly untarred state. 

lab4c_tcp.c is the source file for the TCP version of the sensor program. 

lab4c_tls.c is the source file for the TLS version of the sensor program.
