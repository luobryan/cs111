Description of files:
my_beaglebone.jpg is a selfie of me holding my assembled Beaglebone

connected.png shows that I have given the Beaglebone a name (605303956.lasr.cs.ucla.edu) using the 'hostname' command. It also shows the MAC addresses (with the 'services' command and ConnMan). It also shows me run 'ifconfig' to show the IP addresses. 

copy.png shows a local session in which I copied my trivial hello world program from my laptop to my Beaglebone

build_run.png shows me use a WIFI SSH session in which I built and ran the trivial hello world program. 

git.png shows me use a WIFI SSH session to install git and clone a repository. Even though this screenshot doesn't specifically show me logging in via WIFI SSH, the session used in git.png is the same as WIFI SSH session from build_run.png. 

Makefile is used to build the tarball (with the 'dist' target), and to remove all files created by the Makefile (with the 'clean' target). 

README is this file.
