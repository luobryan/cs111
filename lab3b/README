lab3b.py is the main source file that contains the logic to analyze the csv output and report errors

Makefile is used to build the project. Supported targets are 'clean' (to remove 
all files created by Makefile), 'dist' (to create the tarball), and 
'default' (to build the project and create an executable called lab3b)

README is this file

run_lab_script.sh is a shell script that the Makefile uses to help build the executable.
It checks the number of arguments passed to the program (making sure it is 1), and then 
it uses the 'python3' shell command to execute the python code.
